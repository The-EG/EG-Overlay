# EG-Overlay

EG-Overlay is yet another overlay for GuildWars 2. It is designed to be light weight and 'out of the way' as possible from both a resources and module author point of view. The core is written in ~~C~~Rust and everything else is Lua. Modules can be written purely in Lua, or Lua C modules can also be used.

Setup, configuration, and development are detailed in [the documentation](https://the-eg.github.io/EG-Overlay).
