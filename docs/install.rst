Installation
============

EG-Overlay does not need to be installed, instead it can be run from any
convenient location.

.. warning::
    While it is possible to do so, users should not place EG-Overlay into the
    same folder as GW2.

Release Binaries
----------------

The latest release can always be found at the 
`project release page <https://github.com/The-EG/EG-Overlay/releases>`_. Users
can download the pre-built binary from any release by downloading ``EG-Overlay.zip``
from the release assets.

Development Snapshots
---------------------

Development snapshots can be downloaded from the GitHub Actions artifacts for
the latest commit. To access the artifacts, click the green check mark next to
the commit comment at the top of the repo:
